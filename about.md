Hello! I'm SJ, a DevOps, Security, Performance analysis, and Automation enthusiast with experience at the largest companies and scales in the world. I've been in tech for almost 20 years in various capacities, from retail pc repair and helpdesk to traditional systems administration, devops, development, and much more.

I'm presently a Security Engineer at a smaller company that's scaling quickly. I've been an employee at 3 of the fortune 5 over the duration of my career, and I've worked on some of the largest scale systems in the world, as well as the types of scrappy problems that get small companies off the ground.

In my free time, I've got interest in Software Defined Radio, bicycling, fishing, and video games. I like breadmaking and cooking, especially for other people.
