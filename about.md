Hello! I'm SJ, a DevOps, Security, Performance analysis, and automation enthusiast with experience at the largest companies and scales in the world. I've been in tech for almost 20 years in various capacities, from retail pc repair and helpdesk to traditional systems administration, devops, development, and much more.

I'm presently a Staff Security Engineer at one of the largest scale companies in the world, and I've worked at 3 of the fortune 5 over the duration of my career, and some of the largest scale systems in the world.

In my free time, I've got interest in Software Defined Radio, bicycling, fishing, and video games. I like breadmaking and cooking, especially for other people.
