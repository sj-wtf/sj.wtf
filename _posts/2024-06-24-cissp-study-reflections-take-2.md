Another post about taking my CISSP! I've learned some lessons about myself and what I need to do to get certifications. Primarily, I now know that I will avoid spending money, even if it's not my money, to my own detriment. The main reason I haven't yet taken my exam is because I put off buying an exam voucher over and over. I've read the entire ISC2 CISSP book for the current version of the exam several times over, but every time I get to the end, I tell myself "let's wait for a better time to spend that money".

This time, I've started by buying vouchers. ISC2 has [a promotion](https://www.isc2.org/landing/exam-peace-of-mind) running right now where you can get a voucher and a guaranteed retake at a discount. I didn't have to retake my CCSP exam when I first took it 3 years ago, but it's nice to have the assurance that I have another try already lined up if I need it.

Anyway, right now, I'm just waiting for the vouchers to hit my inbox. Once I have them, I'll be picking a date in mid-to-late-July to take my CISSP, then a date the week after to renew my CCSP. By the end of July, I should have 2 more certs! Next up, I have my eye on the CISA ISO 27001 Lead Auditor certification. I hope to have that by the end of August, which should allow my consulting firm to take more engagements around ISO 27001 auditing. If you're looking for an auditor, [contact us](https://mncloudconsulting.com/contact/)!

Update: I've received my vouchers! I've scheduled my CISSP for July 11th and my CCSP for July 18th.
